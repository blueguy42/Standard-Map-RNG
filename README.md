# Random Number Generation using the Standard Map

This repository contains an implementation of a random number generator algorithm based on the standard map equations. The algorithm utilizes the chaotic behavior of the standard map to generate random numbers with high randomness and no discernible patterns.

The folder `analysis` contains the figures used for the analysis part of the paper.

## Features

- Generates random numbers based on the values of the standard map equations.
- Allows customization of the number of digits in the generated random numbers.

## Usage

1. Set the initial values for the standard map equations, i and o.
2. Specify the number of random numbers to generate, n.
3. (Optional) Adjust the value of the chaotic constant k and the number of digits, exp, in the random numbers.
4. Run the algorithm to obtain an array of random numbers.
